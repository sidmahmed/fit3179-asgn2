                        1945, over 7.5 million people have made Australia their home. Parament migrants enter Australia
                        either through the migration program for skilled and family migrants or through humanitarian
                        program for refugees. Migrating to another country is a big step to take. The information here

                                When it comes to skilled migration, New South Wales and Victoria have always been the
                                states offering the highest number of migrations. Other states like Queensland and
                                Western Australia used to have low migration numbers but they increased their efforts
                                after 2005 and the numbers have since quadrupled. In 2009 and 2010, there was an overall
                                decrease in the number of migrations due to the global financial crisis. New South
                                Wales, Victoria and Western Australia recovered quickly but Queensland has been more or
                                less stagnant. From 2013 onwards, the states started to become more conservative in the
                                number of migrations they take and they never really caught upto their 2005 numbers.

                                Skilled visa has always been the most common form of migration. Usually in the cases of
                                families, the primary applicant applies for a skilled visa. Their dependents then apply
                                for a family visa. We can see an overall downward trend in the number of skilled and
                                family visa migrations. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian Government had
                                already reduced the number of permanent residency visas available from approximately
                                190,000 to approximately 160,000. In 2018-2019, there were 140,366 visas granted, the
                                lowest figure over the past 15 years. With the Australian borders currently closed,
                                2020-21 will likely see the lowest number of new permanent visas granted.

                                Before applying for migration, it is is important to know employers in which industries
                                have historically been more inclined to offer migrations. Accommodation and Food
                                Services employers have historically offered the most sponsorships followed by
                                Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and Health Services. The declining
                                number of migrations in Health Services can be concerning specially during the pandemic.
                                As Australia comes out of COVID-19 lock down and tourists start to arrive again, we
                                could see a spike in the number of sponsorships in Accommodation and Food Services.

                                Cooks, Software developers and restaurants managers have received the most number of
                                employer sponsored migrations. But if we take a look at independent skilled migrations,
                                we find that Accountants and Registered Nurses have also made the list. This discrepancy
                                could be because the later occupations do not necessarily need sponsorships from
                                employers.

                                There is always a concern within migrants about whether or not they will get a job. And
                                if they do, how long they will be able to keep it. Historically, there has been some
                                discrepancy in the unemployment rate between the Australian born population and migrants
                                with migrants having a slightly higher unemployment rate. But from the graph we can see
                                that this gap is slowly decreasing. Therefore, this should not be a cause for concern.

                                Another concern many people have is whether or not they might have switch to field
                                different from their background in order to find a job. This is a very legitimate
                                concern and historical data shows that the number of migrants who can find a job in
                                their respective field has seen some decline. But it's not all doom and gloom. Even if
                                they don't find a job in their respective field, there is still opportunities to find
                                jobs in closely related fields.

                                Finally, we take look at the countries where majority of migrants are coming from.
                                Historically, most of Australian were from the United Kingdom. But we can see than as
                                time passed, India over took the United Kingdom as the country where most migrants come
                                from. This can be attributed to the technology boom in India and a large number of
                                skilled Indians immigrating to other countries. The number of Chinese immigrants has
                                also increased with China overtaking Philippines in 2012.

                                To sum up everything we have seen so far, Australia is still an attractive migration
                                destination for a lot of people with Victoria and New South Wales being the top two
                                states. Skilled migration is most common form of migration to Australia. Hospitality,
                                professional services and healthcare have historically been the industries of choice for
                                migrants. Cooks, software developers, restaurant managers, accountants and registered
                                nurses are the professions with very good outlook for migration. If you migrate to
                                Australia you can expect to work in the field of your study. And finally, majority of
                                migrants come from India, United Kingdom, Philippines, China and South Africa.
